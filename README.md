# Mastering DSA From Zero To Hero

I am a bit excited about what I'm doing here. I haven't tried this pattern before. The pattern 
of doing DSA and then writing my own unit tests for it instead of manual testing. 

I've been able to expore concepts which I thought I knew in C# but I didn't. I'm also playing with Nunit3 which is super cool.
This should be fun :)
